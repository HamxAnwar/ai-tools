# Change: Update README Documentation

## Why
The current README.md provides a basic overview but lacks detailed information about the OpenSpec workflow, directory structure, and how contributors should use the spec-driven development process. This can lead to confusion for new contributors and inconsistent development practices.

## What Changes
- Add a new section "OpenSpec Workflow" explaining the three-stage process (Proposal → Implementation → Archive)
- Update the "Development" section to include more specific guidance on using OpenSpec commands
- Add information about the openspec/ directory structure
- Include links to relevant OpenSpec documentation files

## Impact
- Affected code: README.md
- Affected systems: Documentation and contributor onboarding
- No breaking changes to functionality
